## To Do List

1. Add dashboard table of 10 recent touched/searched/updated clients unique to the logged in user. User can click on these contacts which will send them to the individual contact view.

2. Add a quick search form that queries the database for all results matching the search parameters. When hitting submit or enter it will redirect them to the results page with all of the results from their search.

3. Create a base layout that will be used for the majority of views which will include a nav including clickable buttons that redirect to various views.

4. Create an advanced search form that works in the same manner as the quick search form from dashboard with extended search options.

5. Create a feature that allows for exporting customizable contact data based on select object attributes. (exportable reports)

## Completed

1. Completed authentication login feature logout button with redirection to dashboard.

2. Completed login requirements for all views other than the login page. Users must be logged in to have access to any page on the website. If not, they are redirected to the login page.
